In P1, P3, P4 code fragments it is not "return" procedure. If we find required value x, the part of code that go after loop does not know which "i" is correct.
Example for P3, P4:
Array[1,2,3] Required value:2
Output: False, because "if" condition take i=0.

Example for P1:
Array:[1,2,3] Required value:2
Output: False, because 2!=t[1]

P2: 
infinite loop.
